# Screencast: Partial Edge Drawing

[Waltz 1.29.1](https://github.com/finos/waltz/releases/tag/1.29.1) introduces an improved way to look at complex flow graphs. 
_Partial Edge Drawing_ is a technique where only part of each edge is drawn between vertices.  
This has the effect of reducing diagram clutter whilst preserving the ability to see which nodes are hubs and which are spokes.
A recent Observable demonstration, [Partial Edge Drawing](https://observablehq.com/@zakjan/partial-edge-drawing) by Jan Žák, illustrates the technique very well.

The screencast below shows the fetaure in action.  For the implementation details the changes are all against this issue: [#5190](https://github.com/finos/waltz/issues/5190)
