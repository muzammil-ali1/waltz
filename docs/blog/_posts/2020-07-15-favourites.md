This new feature allows you to quickly add applications into an (automatically created)
Favourite group.  Apps can be added and removed by toggling the bookmark icon next to the 
application name.  As these favourite groups are implemented using App groups the standard
viewing and management features are available.

Once a favourite group has been populated we use it to customise the homepage.  In this first 
release we have a calendar heatmap which shows changes to the records related to 
the apps.  This can be used to get an immediate oversight of what is changing within 
Waltz.    

If you have questions please contact us via [Github issues](https://github.com/finos/waltz/issues/).
