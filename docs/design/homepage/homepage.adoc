= Homepage redesign
:toc:

== Status

**Partial implementation** - Waltz 1.26 delivered the change and survey/attestation
summaries. The timeline features are not yet implemented. Scope is defined via the
new favourite app group feature (also in 1.26)


== Problem

The Waltz homepage is largely static.  Only including recently viewed entities and
a collection of app-groups a user has either created or 'subscribed' to.  The lack
of fresh information on the homepage leads to it being rarely (intentionally) visited.
To get an overview of _"what's happening"_ a user must undertake a trawl through
the Waltz dataset. This trawl is time consuming and tedious and therefore infrequently
happens leading to a lack of awareness of important changes.


== Overview

When users visit Waltz they  wish to see what recent changes have taken place
on entities that they care about. They would like to see tasks assigned to them,
for example surveys and attestations.


== Reporting Data sets

=== Scope

**Status: completed** : The implemented solution was to build upon the favourite group functionality.
Favourite groups were pre-populated (by examining involvement records) using a batch process.

Defining which applications (or other entities) are in the reporting scope for a
user will need to be considered.  Approaches include:

* App associations via `involvement` records
** Peer associations (look for colleagues and inherit their involvements)
* Explicit inclusion via a 'favourite' app group
* Org unit based

Or some combination of the above.

These approaches may work for many users however we need some way to limit the
scope for users with large application portfolios.  For example, senior employees
are often associated with many applications dues to oversight roles.

To mitigate this, avoiding flooding these users with data, we may wish to allow users
to modify their 'subscription' settings by:

* (de)selecting specific apps
* (de)selecting involvement roles
* include/exclude peer associations

=== Changes

**Status: completed** : An interactive change summary widget was delivered in 1.26.

Waltz keeps detailed changelogs for entities in the `change_log` table.  If
a user has 'noisy' applications in their scope the detail could quickly become
overwhelming.

To mitigate this we could simply show a list of changed applications
possibly with some annotations about the number of change types.


=== Change Sets, Decomms & Comms

Waltz has information about both historic and upcoming change sets (which typically
describe alterations to the data flow landscape) as well as decommissioning information
(both at the app level and the app/measurable level).

=== Attestations and Surveys

**Status: completed** : A simple summary widget was introduced in Waltz 1.26

== Design thoughts

=== Detailed Historic data

==== Overview table

|===
|App |Change type |Change count

|AppA

==== Contribution graph

Github style contribution graph:

=== Milestone data

Better for sparse data.  For example change sets, releases, decomms etc.

==== Timelines

=== Mockup

Combining these aspects could give a redesign similar to
